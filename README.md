# 3D Printer Animation Project

This is a 3D printer animation created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project features a realistic 3D printer model with animation effects that simulate the printing process.

## Features

- Realistic 3D printer model built with CSS transforms
- Interactive animation that starts when clicking the printer
- Paper feed animation that simulates printing
- Printer sound effects during operation
- Control panel with buttons and display screen
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes

## How It Works

1. The printer is constructed using multiple CSS 3D-transformed elements to create a realistic 3D effect.
2. When clicked, the printer activates with several animations:
   - The printer body shakes slightly to simulate movement
   - Paper appears to feed through the printer
   - The display screen shows "printing" text
   - Printer sound effects play
3. Clicking again stops the animation and resets the printer.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the printer
- `style.css`: Contains all the CSS styling and animations
- `script.js`: Handles the click interaction and animation toggling

## Usage

1. Simply open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Click anywhere on the printer to start/stop the animation

## Customization

You can modify:
- The printer colors in the CSS
- The animation timing in the CSS keyframes
- The sound effect by changing the audio source URL
- The display text in the HTML
