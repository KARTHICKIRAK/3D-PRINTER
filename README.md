# Printer Animation Project

## Overview
This is a 3D printer animation created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project features a realistic 3D printer model that animates when clicked, complete with sound effects and paper printing simulation.

## Project Structure
The project consists of three main files:
1. `index.html` - The HTML structure of the printer
2. `style.css` - All the styling and 3D transformations
3. `script.js` - The animation logic

## Key Features
- **3D Printer Model**: Created entirely with CSS 3D transforms
- **Interactive Animation**: Click the printer to start/stop the animation
- **Sound Effects**: Printer sounds play during animation
- **Paper Printing Simulation**: Paper appears to come out of the printer
- **Screen Display**: LCD screen shows "printing" status

## Technical Notes
- The original project was converted from Pug (HTML preprocessor) to standard HTML
- The styling was converted from SCSS to standard CSS
- Uses CSS 3D transforms to create the printer geometry
- Implements CSS animations for the printing effect
- Includes JavaScript to handle the click interaction

## How to Use
1. Simply click anywhere on the printer to start the animation
2. Click again to stop it
3. The animation includes:
   - Printer vibration effect
   - Paper coming out of the tray
   - Sound effects
   - Screen text animation

## Credits
- **Design**: Guillaume Kurkdjian 
- **Conversion**: Converted from Pug/SCSS to HTML/CSS

The project demonstrates advanced CSS 3D techniques and shows how complex 3D objects can be created using only CSS transforms and HTML elements.
